## Before you start

### Keep the goal in mind

The goal of the exercise is to show that there is potential for a further analysis of the problem.
To the people involved in this problem, this analysis is only a small puzzle piece. We are not going to roll out a new model, or make major changes to to our processes, based on your analysis alone. This means that you only need to touch on the particularities of the data and make them visible to other people.

Similarly, the real goal of the exercise is to get an interview. Making us want to meet you in person is more important that using the right jargon or coming up with the right numbers.

### Use the tools you're comfortable with

You shouldn't have to install anything new to do the exercise. You shouldn't need to learn any new tools either.

If you use Notebook style tools (R markdown, IPython, etc.), we'll be happy to read notes to yourself.

If you use a mostly visual tool, use screen shots.

### There's no wrong answer

We're not looking for right answers. We're more interested in seeing the approach you take and your ability to make it easy to follow.
We've tried to formulate the questions to go in that direction, but it might be worth making it even clearer.
Don't hesitate to use screen shots, tell us what to look at, etc.

### Don't spend too much time

The exercise has the potential of being very time consuming. We don't want to waste your time. We'd recommend you timebox yourself to 1 hour with a view of having a rough document you could send us at the end of that hour.

The right visuals can save you a lot of time.


You are given a data set and asked to evaluate it for possible use in a future model.

## Step 1

### Field types

Please describe the fields gender, last_connection, x1, x2 & x3 independently from any other fields.
You do not need to write full sentences, but your answer should cover the following questions:
- What kind of data is in the field?
- Is the data complete?
- Does it all look fine?
- Are there obvious patterns in the data?

(Don't spend more than 5 minutes per field)

## Step 2

### Finding correlations / modeling

The team sending us the data believe that there might be some correlations in the data.
They tell us that t1 and t2 are collected one month after x1, x2 and x3.

They believe t1 and t2 could somehow be predicted in advance.

How would you go about testing this?

Can you make your findings obvious to someone who thinks they don't "get maths‚Äù?
